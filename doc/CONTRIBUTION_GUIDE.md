# Contribution Guide

> Like every community, we have some rules, concepts and culture to follow, to maintain good coexistence and quality code

## Introduction

Would you like to contribute to our project? So keep in mind that you must follow the guide below to get your PR approved and incorporated into the codebase.

I recommend that you open issues, participate in our community, ask the creators, and if possible contribute corrections, or new features based on open issue demands, or the project's task list.

If you are unsure whether a feature is under development, check the task board right here on GitHub. Avoid duplicating work or overwriting existing or ongoing functionality.

## Strict Rules

> Please be sure to follow any of the items on this list

1. Read all internal project documentation
2. Read the repository code
3. Run and test locally
4. Understand the style of formatting, writing and connecting things within the project and not breaking any of these standards when creating new code
5. Follow everything recommended in the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_README.md)
6. Test locally before creating a PR
7. Implement unit tests

## Best practices when creating PRs

1. Before creating the PR
   1. Test the code locally
   2. Run the unit tests
   3. If a problem occurs, resolve it
   4. Document whatever is necessary
   5. Run the build
   6. Update project version (following semver)
2. During PR creation
   1. Fix merge conflicts with `main` (if it exists)
   2. Fill out the template correctly
   3. Direct to `main`
   4. Assign due reviewers to PR
3. After PR creation
   1. Signal the PR to the responsible team
   2. Follow comments and review to resolve any issue as soon as possible
   3. Respect request changes and avoid unnecessary problems during review
   4. Be kind and understand other people's points of view
4. After the review
   1. If the review passes without comments, proceed to merge
   2. After the merge, update your local main and publish the new version to NPM (as long as this step is not automated)
   3. If the review is rejected, with change requests, correct the necessary points, and return to step 3
